# BFA Sumbission Bot

**Under development**

A discord bot that tracks submissions for Black Flag Academy's weekly challenges. Includes an admin interface for admin things. Makes heavy use of [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) and [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/).

### Commands

`!help` - shows available commands

`!submit <score> {attached photo}` - Submit a score **with picture** for the BFA Weekly Challenge. This command requires a photo attachment to be part of the message.

#### Faculty/Admin only

`!newweek [optional week number] <challenge name>` - Start a new weekly challenge

## Deployment

## Things to do

important/bugfixes:
- [ ] fix submission upscore calculation (should only use latest week's scores)
- [ ] add level to student model
  - https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/models/fields/#choices

bot stuff:
- [x] initial bot setup
- [x] add things to db on submission
- [ ] bot testing?
- [ ] bot resume/catchup after off/on
- [ ] auto determine student level (freshman, etc) by discord role

web stuff:
- [x] figure out django lol
- [ ] implement auth req'd (adding views to admin? https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ref/contrib/admin/#adding-views-to-admin-sites)
- [ ] view all submissions
- [ ] view by week + role/level
- [ ] view by user (in week?) (auto sort by latest or highest submission)

later:
- [ ] discord commands to close/open submissions (restricted to faculty role)
- [x] discord command to change week (restricted to faculty role)
- [ ] `python manage.py check --deploy` to look for things to change before actually hosting it
- [ ] host on heroku
- [ ] discord oauth for front end login? :thinkingface:
- [x] if the bot told you what your upscore was (if youâ€™re replacing one) like +[x] in green
- [ ] command to let students add/change their dancer name or twitter info
- [ ] add reaction & reply to messages in response

refactoring / legibility
- [ ] move helpers in models.py to helpers.py or something?
- [ ] use discord Cogs to group commands by role requirements
- [ ] better logging
  - use logging instead of print?
- [ ] log before each command: https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ext/commands/api.html#discord.ext.commands.Bot.before_invoke
